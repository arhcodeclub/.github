## Hi there 👋

We are ARHCode, a bunch of nerds from the Adriaan Roland Holst college 🏫 (actually a high school, very confusing) in the Netherlands.

This is our school's site (though that has nothing to do with what we do here): https://arhc.nl

```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main(void)
{
  printf("Thanks for visiting our page!\n");
  
  return 0;
}
```
